# Moire_animation
A set of scripts to generate moire animations from images


Quickstart use:

1. save target images and scripts to the same folder.
2. open kinegram_mkaer.py
3. run kinegram(number of frames, number of bars) 3 frames and 16 bars is a typical input.
4. This will create the image files you need in the same folder
5. if you want a video of the animation to test it, now run make_video(seconds)
6. an Mp4 file will be saved to the same folder. If it's a big file, windows media player will fail but VLC will be able to run it.

The other script files will be called from the main one.
ImageSlicer_main is a tweak of someone elses' work, and all of this repo adopts the same license as the origionator did:
https://github.com/samdobson/image_slicer/blob/master/LICENSE

The PIP version of that repo is incorrect, so I include a copy of the working code here for stability.
